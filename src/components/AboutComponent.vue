          <p class="text-xl text-white mb-2">If you have no idea what a CTF is, <a class="text-pink-600" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A" target="_blank"><u>this video</u></a> should help. magpieCTF is a jeopardy style, team based, totally online CTF taking place over two days with thousands of dollars in cash prizes and subscriptions. This is a beginner to intermediate level CTF, so if you're brand new to CTFs/cybersecurity/hacking this is your chance to get started!</p>
          <p class="text-xl text-white">Our first annual CTF will be 80s themed (culture, movies, music, technology). Calgary tech companies are watching (some are participating!) and they will have space online to talk to you during the competition as your test your skills and show them what you can do!</p>

          <p class="text-xl text-white">Prizes are limited to high school and university students in Western Canada. CTF is a team sport, and the maximum team size is 5. You don't have to be on a team but it REALLY helps and is more fun. We've limited the number of tickets so sign up as soon as you can. You register as an individual and then created/join a team later.</p>
